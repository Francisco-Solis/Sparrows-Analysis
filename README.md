# Sparrows-Analysis

# Overview:
This project analyzes the **Sparrows** dataset in R, focusing on exploratory regression techniques and model diagnostics. This analysis walks through fundamental statistical concepts and applies them to real data. 
# Content:
1. Sparrows_Dataset_Findings.pdf -Discussion of results
2. Sparrow_Statistical_Analysis.pdf - Full report with code and plots
3. Sparrows_source_code.Rmd - Source file for reproducibility in R and or contributions
# Requirements:
1. R must be version 4.0 or greater
2. R packages required for analysis- ggplot2, dplyr, Stat2Data (source for Sparrow dataset) 
# Analysis Overview:
The report answers the following questions
1. Determining sample size and number of variables in the dataset
2. Examining strength, direction and relationship of variables in the scatterplot
3. Reporting of regression intercepts and slopes
4. Standard deviation and its degrees of freedom
5. Calculation of residuals and interpretation
6. Verifying model conditions via diagnostic plots
7. Identifying outliers and or influential points using the residuals and leverage diagnostic plots
# Key findings:
Wing length is a significant and moderately strong predictor of weight in sparrows. The model is reliable for capturing this relationship, though some heteroscedasticity (unequal variance) suggests predictions are less consistent for sparrows with larger wing lengths. No problematic outliers or influential points were found.

# Contributing:
This project was created as a statistical exercise. Suggestions for extending the analysis ( adding multiple regression or interaction terms) are welcome
